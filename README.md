Clinton,

I have obviously not completed, nor gotten close. I think I am definitely gaining understanding though.
I read two helpful articles on RE, you can check them out, if you'd like:
http://www.python-course.eu/python3_re.php
http://www.python-course.eu/python3_re_advanced.php

I typically underestimate how hard/long assignments are. I also tend to want to do as much going back
through notes/reading/figuring out as much as I can about a topic BEFORE really starting the assignment
that deals with that topic. I.e. when I feel like I'm "ready" to start the HW, there's not enough time
to finish it. I suppose I could just start the HW right (probly a good idea), but, I also feel like
I may get stuck on something very easy/obvious if I had only done a little more learning before starting
How do you deal with this?/recommend approaching this?

With regular expressions, it seems that practice makes perfect. I have a good idea of what is going on/
how to find out what is going (with RE), now I need to practice.
See you in class,
Will
